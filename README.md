You may know the [jq JSON command line processor][web:jq]. You may also know the [ammonite REPL][web:ammonite-repl]. Now imagine that you combine these two awesome tools into single one and you have the __sjq__.

__sjq__ is small tool written in [Scala][web:scala] that compiles your input _JSON_ into _Scala case classes_, so you can use __Scala expressions__ and commands __to manipulate your data__ and then export them again as _JSON_ (if needed). And thanks to the embedded [ammonite REPL][web:ammonite-repl], you can use all that goodies such as __syntax highlighting__, __auto completion on TAB__ and much more! Manipulating _JSON_ data has never been easier :-)

> ðŸš§ __Work in Progress__ ðŸš§ - This software is under active development and hasn't even reached its initial public release. Please bear in mind that documentation is likely missing and API and/or command line interface can change unexpectedly. At least for now, below is small demo how you can use __sjq__ right now.
