You may know the [jq JSON command line processor][web:jq]. You may also know the [ammonite REPL][web:ammonite-repl]. Now imagine that you combine these two awesome tools into single one and you have the __sjq__.

__sjq__ is small tool written in [Scala][web:scala] that compiles your input _JSON_ into _Scala case classes_, so you can use __Scala expressions__ and commands __to manipulate your data__ and then export them again as _JSON_ (if needed). And thanks to the embedded [ammonite REPL][web:ammonite-repl], you can use all that goodies such as __syntax highlighting__, __auto completion on TAB__ and much more! Manipulating _JSON_ data has never been easier :-)

> ðŸš§ __Work in Progress__ ðŸš§ - This software is under active development and hasn't even reached its initial public release. Please bear in mind that documentation is likely missing and API and/or command line interface can change unexpectedly. At least for now, below is small demo how you can use __sjq__ right now.

## 3. Installation

> At this moment, there's no binary distribution of sjq. Stay tuned, it's planned to be added soon :-)

### 3.1. From Source Code
In order to build __sjq__ from source code, you need to have installed the [sbt][web:sbt].

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/vaclavsvejcar/sjq.git
$ cd sjq/
$ sbt assembly
```

Then grab the built _JAR_ file from `./target/scala-2.13/sjq-assembly-<VERSION>.jar` and you're ready to go!

## 4. Usage
__sjq__ offers two different modes, the __Interactive (REPL) Mode__ which uses the _ammonite REPL_ for interactive work, and __Non-interactive (CLI) Mode__ which is useful when you need to call __sjq__ from another shell script, etc.
